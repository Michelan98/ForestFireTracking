# ForestFireTracking

This a Database design and implementation project for a database aiming to serve as a tool for scientist to track changes in animal biodiversity in different forests in the world due to Forest Fires.

The database is equipped with a simple User interface that allows the user to view, enter and remove data from the database, as well as a flagging functionality for displaying endangered species based on recent updates of forest population counts. 

The data in this database is not real and served as a tool for testing the functionalities of the database.
